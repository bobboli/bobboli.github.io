I am currently a master student at ETH Zurich, major in Visual Computing. I received B.S. in Computer Science & Biological Science from Peking University in 2019. After that, I joined Timi Studios, Tencent Games and worked as a graphics engineer, focusing on game engine (UE4) and mobile game development.

I am interested in and devoting to computer graphics. My previous experience is mainly around real-time rendering, and I am also broadening my interest and skills to more areas like physics simulation and animation :)
